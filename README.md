## Description


This dataset is licensed under a CC-BY-4.0 license

Available online at https://zenodo.org/record/5263195

## Notes

The data used here was extracted from the Excel file shared on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/5263195). The file also contains the nexus file which the authors derived, which was separated here.

When preparing the dataset, Proto-Vietic is treated as a language on its own rights, but since cognate sets are not assigned from Proto-Vietic forms, these are left empty. As a result, the data cannot be used directly to check, for example, for the correctness of automatic linguistic reconstructions.
